# COV19D 
The project includes working on a chest CT-scan series of images aiming to develop an automated classification algorithm for Covid-19/non-Covid-19 diagnosis. https://mlearn.lincoln.ac.uk/mia-cov19d/ 

## The codes
The codes develop deep learning classification models and Transfer Learning Based Classification Models:   
### 1. Deep Learning Classification Models: 
*A)* A CNN model solution for COVID-19 diagnosis from CT-Scan images. Code:D_Image_Classification_binary_cross_loss.ipynb'.
<br /> *B)* A CNN model with Macro f1 as a loss function solution. Code: 3D_Image_Classification.ipynb'.
<br /> *C)* A deep learning model solution, which is a modification of UNET model architecture. Code: 3D_Image_Classification_with_Modified_UNET_Architecture.ipynb 
<br/><br/>

### 2. Transfer Learning Based Classification Models:
*A)* A transfer learning method using VGG16 model for feature exctraction followed by Random Forest classifier to take the final dicision. Code: Transfer_Learning_VGG16_RF.ipynb
